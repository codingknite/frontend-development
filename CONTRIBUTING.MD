# Adding Resources

Please be sure to keep the following in mind before adding a new resource:

- Make sure you indicate whether the resource is a paid resource. Do that by adding 💵 at the end of the resource name.
- If your resource is a course, please indicate the platfoarm or instructor of the course before it's name.

  `course platform / intructor - [course name](course link)`

  The same applies if your resource is a documentation.

- Do not provide descriptions unless indicated or done with other resources on the repo.
- We accept all resources but most favourably resources that you've used before or you know are of exceptional quality.
- If you would like to add a new category, open an issue to inform the contributor before hand.
- Make sure your resource doesn't exist in the repo before making your contribution
- Double check to make sure the link to your resource is working.

And that's it.

Thanks for making this repo better for everyone.❤
